# Webpack + Bootstrap template for Vue.js

This just a Vue.js template based on https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack that included [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

```sh
$ vue init ExUltima/vue-template-bootstrap my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

The development server will run on port 8080 by default. If that port is already in use on your machine, the next free port will be used.
